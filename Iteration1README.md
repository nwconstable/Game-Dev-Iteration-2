# Iteration 1: Pirate and Dinosaur Tower Defense Game

## Write down the major aspects of your game that you are the least sure about.
* Main treasure mechanic. Specifically, ensuring that multiple playstyles are viable.
* Level design. How to create many waves.
* Difficulty. How to balance enemies, towers, waves while keeping multiple playstyles in mind.
* Is it fun?

## What are the core game mechanics that need to be fun for your game to work?
* Variety of playstyles. For example, a high amount of treasure with low defenses, a low amount of treasure with high defenses, or a middle-ground approach.
* Difficulty in balancing defenses against pirates and dinosaurs. Certain "towers" will be more effective against pirates than dinosaurs and vice-versa.
* Increasing difficulty as waves progress. Throughout the game, waves will have an increasing number of enemies which will be harder to defeat.

## What are the key features you would need to have in place to test out those mechanics?
* Treasure bar that can be spent on defense.
* Basic enemies that spawn in waves.
* Basic towers that can be placed on a level.

## Can you imagine a bare bones prototype that would allow you to test just those mechanics?
Probably, yeah.

## Write down a list of features you would like to have implemented by the end of the first iteration.
* Have a basic level to play on.
* Have at least one wave.
* Be able to place towers.
* Have a treasure mechanic (effectively health bar).
* Have a basic enemy that spawns.
