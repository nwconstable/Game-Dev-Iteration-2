Prepare to embark on an adventure on the high seas! Pirate Booty Defense is a tower defense game where you have to defend your gold against incoming enemy pirates. Place upgradable towers on land or sea to ward them off. But try not to get overwhelmed by pirates because if you lose all your gold, it's game over!
